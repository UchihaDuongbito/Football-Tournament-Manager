## task 2

For this term's project, I propose to develop a Java desktop application called "Custom Tournament Creator," designed to allow users to set up and manage football tournaments with varying numbers of participants. This application will cater to a large number of football enthusiasts, who seek a customizable platform to organize and simulate different tournament formats such as knockout, league, or round-robin. Users can define the number of clubs or players, set the tournament rules, and generate schedules and results based on the input parameters. The application will also feature an interactive interface where results can be updated in real-time and viewed in various statistical formats, enhancing the user experience by making it easy to track progress and outcomes.

The "Custom Tournament Creator" is intended for football club managers, school football coordinators, and even casual groups looking for an organized way to manage their football events. This project appeals to me as it combines my passion for sports, particularly football, with my skills in software development, creating a tool that not only serves practical needs but also promotes engagement and community among football fans. By providing a flexible and user-friendly platform, this application aims to simplify the complexities involved in tournament planning and execution, ensuring that football events of any scale can be managed efficiently and successfully.

## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new football club and add to it a list of football clubs 
- As a user, I want to be able to select a football club and add a new player to the football club (usually there are only 11 players from a club in a single match but a club can have other players on the bench, on loan, or having injures)
- As a user, I want to be able to select a football club and list the points each participating club has, and the results of every match 
- As a user, I want to be able to select a football club and list all the players on that football club 
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save the entire state of the football tournament application (including all participating clubs, matches, and results) and have the option to do so or not
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be able to load the entire state of the football tournament, so that I can resume exactly where I left off at some earlier time

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple players to a club" by clicking the "Add Player" button on the tool bar. This will open a dialog where you can enter the player's details (name, position, nationality, and age) and add them to the club
- You can generate the second required action related to the user story "filtering players by position" by selecting the "Filter players" button on the tool bar. This will open a dialog where you can enter a position and view the players in that position
- You can locate my visual component by looking at the background image of the main window, which features a football stadium
- You can save the state of my application by selecting "Save" from the "File" menu
